Perelandra Penetrator
=====================

This game was created in a few hours<sup>†</sup> on the morning of 2014-04-02. It's pretty
much just an interactive in-joke for [MobyGames][1] contributors and approvers,
inspired by [a discussion on the MobyGames forum][2]. Despite this, it does have
multiple endings (two!), and a few things to poke at.

You can play the game online (or download the story file) [here][3]

<sup>†</sup> <small>File created 8:40 a.m. Game published 12:19 p.m. Not the speediest
of Speed-IF, but no unending epic.</small>

This will be brief: it's My Game for (mostly) Me, by Me, Myself.
